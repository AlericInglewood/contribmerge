A three-way doc/contributions.txt merger.

SYNOPSIS
       contribmerge [ options ] left base right

DESCRIPTION
       contribmerge incorporates all changes that lead from `base' to `right' into `left'.
       The result ordinarily goes into `left'.
       contribmerge is useful for combining separate changes to an original.
       Suppose `base' is the original, and both `left' and `right' are modifications of `base'.
       Then contribmerge combines both changes.

OPTIONS
       -p     Send results to standard output instead of overwriting file 'left'.

       -q     Quiet; do not warn about conflicts.

       -V     Print version number.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 for no conflicts, 1 for some conflicts, 2 for trouble.
